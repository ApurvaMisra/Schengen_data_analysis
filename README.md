# Schengen_data_analysis

This repository consists of traceroute plots of the data collected over a year as part of the schengen project. <br/>
It has been observed that there are a few countries like US, Cyprus, Mauritius, Singapore, South Africa, Cote d'ivoire to which a small number of packets traveled to while on the way to their targets (*it can be observed in the gifs or map_routes*).<br/>
The number of packets traveling to non-schengen countries based on days of week show no unusual pattern.<br/>
The number of packets traveling based on times of the day show peaks during nights and early morning but this could entirely depend on when RIPE ATLAS conducted the traceroutes as each one of the measurements were inititalised to be done every 72 hours.<br/>
The number of packets traveling to each country based on any resolution show an abnormally high number for US for it being a non_european country.<br/>
